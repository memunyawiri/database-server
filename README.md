# Database Server

A practice a tech test to demonstrate my understanding of web technologies.

## The brief
```
"Write a program that runs a server that is accessible on http://localhost:4000/. When your server receives a request on http://localhost:4000/set?somekey=somevalue it should store the passed key and value in memory. When it receives a request on http://localhost:4000/get?key=somekey it should return the value stored at somekey. Store the data in memory, not in a database, but bear in mind that you will later need to add a database to this code."
```

### Requirements

* Clean & well tested code
* Code should be easily extensible to add a data store
